This is a client of TinyPNG for Mac, with which you can compress pngs without open browser and manually download images, all you need to do is just drag and drop.

Check "Anywhere" in `Preferences -> Security & privacy` if you can not open this app. Just for the first time, and I suggest you uncheck it after you open this app for security.
